ok it's late and I actually need to sleep now because it's a school night. 
I tried writing regularly, but I don't think I have the brain power to do so...
Anyway, I've settled into the routine of school, which is good because it is still early on. (*Checks to see if there is homework because he doesn't want to be too confident*)

Alright that's good.

Anyway, wouldn't it be nice if there was no time in the world? I mean, if I had all the time to do all I wanted to, I would finally reach perfection. But no, due to limits of time, I must budget, cutting off such interesting and mind provoking ideas. Anyway, just a thought (circular paragraph!)

Like now, I truly wish I could turn this post, this blog into a thick book of random ideas that come to mind. But unfortunately the reality exists that I will now sleep and then I will probably not have time to write in this until next week. Oh, how the world works.

And how humans are so critical.

I mean really, does every action has to be perfect? Yes, according to our current social norms of a human. Not saying that they shouldn't be not perfect, but perfect is a high standard to hold in such a time constrained world. This hyperreality I live in is perpetuated by the internet, but also by the opinions and groups that people form out of that. Accusatory statements are welcome because it seems to be the only thing anybody can agree on in the world of the internet.

That's an interesting topic! I'll write about it next time, but I really should be getting to bed...
