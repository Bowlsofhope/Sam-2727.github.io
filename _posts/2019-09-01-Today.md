Today is September 1st. I tried to get all my homework done today, but failed. I need to get better at streamlining everything, to increase my efficiency at this stuff. Because there's so much else to do.
Maybe some of it has to do with me watching T.V. and stuff like that that "has no actual change"
Then there is also the editing of wikipedia. That probably has to do with it.
Anyway, now to a more interesting topic.

Sometimes, I wonder how humans are ever going to find an answer to "the universe." I mean, that is the goal of one major branch of science. Isn't fundamental science, i.e. theoretical physics, astronomy, etc. dedicated to discovering what the universe is all about?
I was doing a bit of research right now and learned about "godel's incompletness theorem." What an interesting little (sarcasm) topic!
Still going down that rabbit hole so I'm going to end this here, but with one little caveat. After al the Godel stuff, how do you even know why the axioms exist? They "just do" surely isn't enough!
