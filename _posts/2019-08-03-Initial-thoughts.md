When I first created this, I thought that writing would flow out of my brain and this would be incessently easy to make. But alas

Rather, I am sitting here, forcing myself to write this just to have content.

ok...

I'll write about my current world view! (basically why I made this thing in the first place)
what I find undeniable:
ignorance is the worst problem currently and always facing humanity
Most conflicts come out of a want to fight
humans are really bad at not being selfish
All actions are driven by our emotions (but that's just a repeat of line 15)

Now I tend to work a lot. I like to think that I can push out my emotions, keeping out anything that could get in the way of raw efficiency. But of course that's not the way things work out. For the past few years, I have been na√Øve, slowly digging an island for myself in hopes that there I will be able to achieve goals beyond anything imaginable.
But of course, the undeniable truths of human beings get in the way. I can't seem to finish a project, out of frustration. I can't seem to even start a project once I put it, out of pure laziness and distraction in a commodified world (now that's broad...)

I get distracted with petty acts of notability, like on wikipedia, hoping that somehow I can make a name for myself.
I tell myself I have learned that concentration is the key aspect to any type of success, and indeed, I still believe it is. But the fact that I can't live by my own tenants suggests that something is unilaterally wrong with my disposition. 

I can't seem to find structure in a world that requires it. Everybody recommends a planner, a calendar, and more just to keep track of your personal activities. Organization is paramount in a world where mistakes are frowned upon, despite the "you always learn from mistakes" superficial attitude present in the world. So focused on projects-- and the more I consider it, the more I find that these projects are for short term gains-- to get my name out there when I'm still an unexperienced high schooler.

Perhaps this organization of the world comes from code-- after all, my code never seems to work because of my apparent lack of organization. But I'm only coding to do these aforementioned superficial projects.

Rather, it's necessary to move past this cloud of college admissions and seeming to be some kind of genius in high school and focus on the long term. Obsession might be healthy in the short term, but not the long term. Thus, short term goals must be found to breka up projects into, slow incremental steps towards some always thought of unreachable reality that only becomes reachable once the cloud of unreachability has receded in midlife.

By merely existing, in a Darwinian sense, I must consider myself above all. I am the only one that can experience my conciousness and my state of being. All others are merely tools, objects towards assisting my existence.

But at the same time, these "tools" or other-beings-besides-the-self appear to one to have their own opinions on things, their own physical desires that compete with one's own. Everybody finds that the best way in the world is to contribute a bit of their own work. Just a tiny bit. Some, which have not understood, or at least implicitly understood, the idea of living a human life. That in the end we are still just animals with overly inflated egos.

Those humans (or animals), tend to claim all the credit, but we must be wise. Of course, in a necessarily structured world in order to increase longevity, these beings are idolised. In exaggerated tales, certain beings are said to have effectively changed the course of history forever (I'm thinking albert Einstein, hitler). 

Indeed, through such pseudo-stories (ah yes, the dreaded pseudo, the best way to insult someone in academic terms), individual power of large swaths of people is seen to be iminent. This is what perhaps drives the ego of humanity. That is, the belief that we can all change the world fundamentally, but only if we reach a certain threshold. But in the end, as in the end thousands of years from now, what will remain of these Hitlers and Einsteins and politicians and ordinary people turned world famous figures? (asterisk)
asterisk: Note that most significant changes are actually for the worse in terms of human longevitiy. It is actually very hard to single handedly increase human happiness. Much easier the other way around, as egotistical world leaders have found out.

Nothing. In the mysterious end, all of history (that is, human history) will be destroyed.
Yes, we can invent religious stories to cover up for this fact that all will end and the actions you take in your life will never, ever have any significant lasting impact on the world or the universe. But these stories only go further to reveal that on the inside, humanity is really just... scared.

This can be seen in really any science fiction novel, where humans are always, without exception, relegated a special status amongst alien civilizations. Always at the center of the world, for fear that we are not.

(it's very late, so I have to wrap this off somewhere soon)

So clearly, these pseudo-leaders are wrong. Individuals cannot change the course of history or existence, and it's silly to believe they can. Thus, every human being is equal in their contribution to the world, because that contribution is nothing.

To the familiar reader, all this might seem like a bunch of absurdism, and honestly it probably is. I sound like a Camus for a modern audience. But Camus says that we must do something in life despite the absurd. And that is because Camus is scared of the reality. The reality that actually, we are all wrong and that we probably shouldn't even do anything in life because it doesn't really matter in the end and will just cause us more pain.

But we still do. We have hope that we, in our infitesimally small contributions to the world, can create a summation that does amount to something significant. Afterall, just by living, we are experiencing the most unique (and only) experience in the universe: that of meta-cognition. To not only be alive but to realize that you are alive is an experience worth living by itself.

All the contests, the college admissions, the friends are unncessary when it comes to simple fact of existence.

I say all that I wrote simply to conclude the perhaps trivial fact to some, perhaps dumb fact to others, but in my mind, a very important truth (that I probabaly should add to the list) that:
there is no right thing to do in life. All philosophies are inherently useless because they assume there is a point to life. Thus, don't listen to others, and do what you want to! (within bounds--- don't make yourself miserable please).
