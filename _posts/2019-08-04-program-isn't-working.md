I've been working on it today, but not yesterday (I tell myself it was because of having to attend a funeral, but of course it was procrastination)
And the program shouldn't even be hard to run! It's just a simple find clusters, convert coordinates methedology. But somehow it isn't. Tomorrow, I must get off work early, and work on it as late as possible, because it must work. Even if I am to create a sort of half-baked project for now, this is still a necessary part.
I can always make it sound more impressive in post processing, with saying that the clusters are just potential clusterings, and require additional data and observation to fully flesh out. In fact, that would probably be better, because looking at projects, the execution is what really matters on the poster, not the actual project.

On other things, I took an ACT practice test today. Really did take up most of my day, past 1 at least, and I really only start working in the afternoons on weekends (I need to change this practice-- weekends should be individual work, and weeks should be relax/work, in my system of doing things).

But the ACT really is a joke. I mean, the problems on it don't test intellectual ability, rather just the ability of me to see past the test makers. And it's not like the ACT (or SAT) is doing anything to fix this! I did my entire great ideas final on standardized testing and the flaws of it (and the successes, but there aren't much). They are acclaimed to match success in college, but merely because standardized testing opens up opportunities in college, and if you come from a richer family (more likely to do well in college), you are likely to well on the standardized testing, as you can afford valuable tutors that can teach your kids stuff.

I know this has been a nation-wide topic of conversation with the college admissions scandals going on, but this is deeper, hits closer to the development of the next generation.

I previously talked about ignorance. Now that I think about it, that problem is chiefly a United States one. I think the U.S. is ignoring that our education system, our other systems in place, don't work and there are clear alternatives that could yield higher benefits. 

This is how I think of it. Democracy was effective for a period of time, one where the government had a lot of control, but not too much. Now, that is failing. I'm not saying that democracy should be abolished, because of course I, as a private citizen, aspiring scientist, etc. wouldn't benefit from that, but I think overall, under proper care and not too much on the totaliterian side, a stronger government would go a long way, with less representation from the people facilitating the wide advances that can currently be seen in surprisingly successful for effective dictatorship places like China and Russia (ok maybe just China).

Anyway, I need to move onto another topic. What have I accomplished this summer? No... that's also a depressing topic because out of my three goals: writing, ACT, science fair, and physics studying (ok four goals), I have really only accomplished ACT. But hey, they say aim high, shoot low, the irony being that if you actually know that you are simply aiming high you will never aim high anymore.

In many ways, my life and existence emerges out of cyclical procceses. There is that that of school, weekend, and logner term, school, summer. But more subtly, and even logner term, there is the process of success, failure, rebuild. 7th grade, by all means, was a disaster year for me. Somehow the addition of my first high school weighted courses, topped off with the belief that I could do anything from recent successes, led me to crash in burn, especially in the second semester. Then in eight grade, I redirected the passion inside me to literally change the world to that of achieving very high grades. And it worked. Throughout that, I became very philosphical, much as I am right now.

In 9th grade, my poise and control led to success after success. First grades, then science olympiads, then class president. I was truly on a role. But then came summer and without anybody to check me, my ego went out of control, spiraling me onto a path where I thought everything was easy and I didn't have to try anymore for the results that I got in 9th grade. Then came 10th grade, and while I did ok with respect to Cello All State, everything else I failed at. Grades bad, science olympiad fail, astronomy olympiad fail, summer programs fail. To finish off the process, here I am, philosophising in a very meta fashion as I prepare to enter a year of rebuilding. I have a perfect lineup of classes. Really, I only have to worry about English. That's it! All my other classes should be interesting, mind stimulating, and easy (really the perfect combination).

So long as I maintain my poise, never let my ambitions get the better of me. I must control myself, always promising that I can do better in the not far from now future where I will have the tools to build the success that I have always wanted. Only to wait for that moment in a proven(?) process of education, or at least education that will open certain doors for me. Yes, I can continue to work on science fair and side projects, but only at set times, say on sunday mornings. Sunday evenings shall be for science olympiad, and saturdays shall be for homework. Yes, that sounds like a good system that might work. Of course, I'm really bad at sticking to my plans so we'll see how this goes, but I think if I just repeat the mantra of good grades to good success, I might just get there.

Tomorrow, if I remember to, I'll talk about sticking to schedules and distraction, and see what that tangent leads me to.
